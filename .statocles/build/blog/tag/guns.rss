            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>I write this in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting.
I do so as the narrative is forming that perhaps the heinous act was committed by a Left-Wing extremist.
I don&#39;t care if he was &quot;on my side&quot;, no one that is killing people is &quot;on my side&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want anyone shot.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want Steve Scalise or Gabby Giffords shot.
I don&#39;t want country music fans, movie-goers, or gay men at a nightclub shot.
I don&#39;t want disaffected white men, or gang members shot.
I don&#39;t want college kids, high school kids, or innocent grade school kids shot.</p>

<p>And yet I know it will continue as long as people who want to own deadly weapons, even for good intentions, can do so.</p>

<p>If it turns out this madman was a Left-Winger, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that it was Right-Wingers that let him do it.
The ability to buy death at a WalMart did it; to buy it at a tent at a &quot;gun show&quot; and not even have a cursory background check did it.
The lack of regulation around carrying death on your waist did so; the laws that prevent you from infringing that &quot;right&quot; did so.</p>

<p>Now the right will say that good people with guns stop bad people with guns.
I&#39;d like to see that supported by evidence.
America has more guns than anywhere else, and always rising, and yet by far the most gun deaths.</p>

<p>Anecdotally I only have seen a few cases where a bystander with a gun stopped a shooter.
Those few are swamped by the stories of hot-heads with conceal-carry who lose their temper and become the bad guy rather than the good guy.
I remember video of a man at a gas station mad that the kids in the next car over had their music too loud, so he shot them.
Just one case, but I&#39;ll bet you find more of those than good guy saves the day.</p>

<p>And while I&#39;m on that topic, the good guy can&#39;t &quot;save the day&quot;, he can only make it less horrific.
Especially in states with open-carry, you can&#39;t know someone is the bad guy until they start shooting.
Which means the situation is always reactive.
If the shooter has any skill, people are already dead.
This isn&#39;t prevention, just a stop-gap, and a bad one.</p>

<p>So why do we have this situation?</p>

<p>Well the second amendment says that we have the right to bear arms.
There are basically two schools of thought on this, defense against others and defense against the government.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen above that it is doing a terrible job at the former.
And by the way, I don&#39;t even want to kill someone who would hurt me.
Why do all these defense nuts want to kill others so badly?
They should all be carrying Tasers!</p>

<p>And as to the latter, you and your buddies and your AK&#39;s aren&#39;t going to overthrow the US Government.
You just aren&#39;t.
You&#39;d at least need Howitzers and even then I&#39;m not so sure.</p>

<p>Even if you said it could be tried, what would that look like?
It isn&#39;t rows of men in uniforms with muskets.
It would look like Gabby Giffords and Steve Scalise.
Even Right-Wingers decried the latter attack, since this time the victim was someone &quot;on their side&quot;.</p>

<p>Would banning guns have problems, yeah.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t get them ALL, but you can get most of them.
And then you&#39;d know when you saw someone with them that the situation was already bad.
And people will still commit violence with knives and cars.
But they can&#39;t send death in all directions at large distances.
I&#39;m ok with that kind of progress.</p>

<p>Short of banning guns, we could at least have some controls.
Nearly all of the rights guaranteed to us by the constitution have limits.
There are answers to this problem!</p>

<p>So please can we end this?
I&#39;m tired of worrying about honking at a bad driver, what if they are pissed off and have gun?
I&#39;m tired of going to a movie and checking for exits, and more importantly, something solid to hide behind (yes I do that, you should too).
And mostly, I&#39;m tired of the cloaked blood-lust of the gun enthusiast, it is terrifying.</p>
